-----Project by Fabian C.
---10 HTML tags I used:
<p>
<a>
<u>
<mark>
<h1>
<h5>
<button>
<div>
<figcaption>
<section>
---5 CSS Propreties:
-position
-margin
-font-family
-color
-border-radius

In this project I used various Bootstrap propreties to build appealing and responsive elements ,like a responsive navbar, and I used Javascript to build an ending Pop-up triggered by a button click.
